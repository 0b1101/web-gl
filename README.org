* WebGL

This repository presents a short study of the API WebGL.

** Description 
The project presents three objects:
- An animated and autonomous object;
- An object of which the color can be changed by the user.
- An object of which the rotation can be controlled by the user;

The visual representation below depicts the first object, which is the autonomous one.

Next is the object whose color can be changed by the user. By default, its color is a gradient type. However, that can be changed by pressing '1' for solid colors and '2' for the default gradient option as illustrated below:

The last one is the one whose rotation can be controlled by the user. The controls for this object is as it follows:

- W: increases the 'x' rotation index. The effect produced is:
[[file:readme_gifs/W.gif]]

- S: decreases the 'x' rotation index. The effect produced is:
[[file:readme_gifs/S.gif]]

- D: increases the 'y' rotation index. The effect produced is:
[[file:readme_gifs/D.gif]]

- A: decreases the 'y' rotation index. The effect produced is:
